This is a node and express js application which uses pug templating engine.
 To run this app:
	Go to the directory where the this folder(05-templates) is present and open terminal in that folder.
	Restart your server for better usage.
	Then type : nodemon and press enter.
	Note : if nodemon doesn't work then type : node 05-templates.js and press enter.
	This command initiates the server at the port number 5000.
	So, go to the browser and start localhost by typing "http://localhost:5000" in the search bar.
	This will redirect you the app that is running on the server with portnumber 5000.
	Initially you will see an error on the page . That is because there isn't any definition for route '/'.
	So, after typing "http://localhost:5000" add '/main'("http://localhost:5000/main") and you will see the output of that route(Countries and their Capitals).
	Next try "http://localhost:5000/populous" and "http://localhost:5000/region" for countries with atleast 20 million population in descending order and regions with its number of countries respectively.
