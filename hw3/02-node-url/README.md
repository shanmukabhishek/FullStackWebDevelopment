This is a node application which displays the url querystring in its output.
 To run this app:
	Go to the directory where the this folder(02-node-url) is present and open terminal in that folder.
	Restart your server for better usage.
	Then type : node 02-node-url.js and press enter.
	This command initiates the server at the port number 5000.
	So, go to the browser and start localhost by typing "http://localhost:5000" in the search bar.
	This will redirect you the app that is running on the server with portnumber 5000.
        Then you'll be seeing a white page for the landing route'/' and if you enter the parameters for the querystring after '/'
like: "http://localhost:5000/?hello=world&lorem=ipsum" , a table will be created and the query parameters in the queryString will be displayed.
