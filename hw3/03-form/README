This is a node and express js application which creates a form exercise with client server model.
 To run this app:
	Go to the directory where the this folder(03-form) is present and open terminal in that folder.
	Restart your server for better usage.
	Then type : nodemon and press enter.
	Note : if nodemon doesn't work then type : node 03-form.js and press enter.
	This command initiates the server at the port number 5000.
	So, go to the browser and start localhost by typing "http://localhost:5000" in the search bar.
	This will redirect you the app that is running on the server with portnumber 5000.
        Then you'll be seeing a form for the landing route'/' and enter the details in the form.
	After clicking submit, it will redirect you to the output page which displays the information given in the form.
