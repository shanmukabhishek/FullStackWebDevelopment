This is a node and express js application which creates different sessions/routes.
 To run this app:
	Go to the directory where the this folder(04-sessions) is present and open terminal in that folder.
	Restart your server for better usage.
	Then type : nodemon and press enter.
	Note : if nodemon doesn't work then type : node 04-sessions.js and press enter.
	This command initiates the server at the port number 5000.
	So, go to the browser and start localhost by typing "http://localhost:5000" in the search bar.
	This will redirect you the app that is running on the server with portnumber 5000.
        Then you'll be seeing a welcome message for the landing route'/' and after that whatever route you enter in the search bar will be displayed as a message.
	There will also be a track of the routes that you have previously visited.
