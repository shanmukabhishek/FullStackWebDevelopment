This is a Google Maps Platform based with a Nearby Search Service Finder.
 To run this filre :
	Open the folder(07-google maps) and run the html file named 07-google-maps.
	Initially the browser will ask you for permission to allow geolocation in your system.
	Then you'll be able to see a map which is google map platform based.
	You'll initially find your location in the map but as we change the location in the keyword/location name in the searchkeyword() function in the JavaScript document, you'll be able to then see the location of the name you entered.
	You'll find a lot of markers on the map which are nearby businesses, and clicking on them gives you the information about that place.
