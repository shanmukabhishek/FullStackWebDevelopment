This is a node application which displays several outputs for different routes.
 To run this app:
	Go to the directory where the this folder(01-node-routes) is present and open terminal in that folder.
	Restart your server for better usage.
	Then type : node 01-node-routes.js and press enter.
	This command initiates the server at the port number 5000.
	So, go to the browser and start localhost by typing "http://localhost:5000" in the search bar.
	This will redirect you the app that is running on the server with portnumber 5000.
        Then you'll be seeing a welcome message for the landing route'/.
	After that if you enter different routes like '/cache' , '/cookie'... etc, each route will display it's own output which is written in its function in the JavaScript file.
